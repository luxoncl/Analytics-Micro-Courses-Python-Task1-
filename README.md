An interactive shopping list application that allows users to add, remove, view, and clear items while implementing features like item confirmation, error handling, and the option to restart or exit.
Add Item: Users can add items to their shopping list by typing the item name.
Remove Item: Users can remove an item from the list by specifying its name.
Show List: Displays all items in the shopping list with numbered options for easy reference.
Clear List: Allows users to clear all items from the list in one command.
Item Confirmation: Before removing an item, users are asked to confirm their action to avoid accidental deletions.
Error Handling: Validates user inputs to ensure they follow the correct format and prompts users to re-enter inputs when necessary.
Restart or Exit: After completing an action, users are given the option to either start a new task or exit the program.
User Experience: The program provides a clear menu, guiding users through their choices. The user is asked to confirm sensitive actions (like removing an item) and any invalid inputs are handled gracefully, ensuring smooth interaction. The program keeps running until the user opts to exit.
